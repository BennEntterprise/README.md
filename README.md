# Kyle's README.md: How to get the most out of your Kyle

This document is a brief description of how to effectively work with me. I've learned a lot of lessons over time and I hope this wil help you get the most out of our interactions. Everything below is a heuristic, and not a hard rule. I try to be flexible and adapt to the needs of the team, but these are some of the things that work well for me.


## TLDR; Too-Long, Didn't Read the Whole Thing

- I'm direct, and often sarcastic but I try to be kind, helpful and playful.
- My partner is a Project Manager. It's important to me that an engineering team owns and cultivate strong project management practices, not just the PM or Product Owner.
- Ping me whenever, I manage notifications on my devices with Do Not Disturb and Focus modes.
- I prefer one long message, over 20 little ones (Chats, Slack, etc).
- I strive for inbox zero. 
- I have a tendency to skip meetings without a clear agenda in the description, or I'll bother you to fill one out.
- I often ask questions for clarity of parrot for comprehension. _"What I'm hearing you say is ____, is that correct?"_

# Communication

In general I strive to be an _Inbox Zero_ kind of person. I spend a lot of time minimizing superfluous notifications, cultivating a healthy signal-to-noise ratio across my devices and applications. With that in mind, I prefer to keep my communication channels as **clear and high-fidelity as possible** . Below are some guidelines I follow and encourage for those who work with me.

## Email: Treat it like snail mail

As a software developer, I really don't use email too much. I check it at least once daily (typically in the morning) and will make a note to respond to anything important, however _most_ of my email communication tends to be engineering newsletters I use to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. Or like you're regular mail, mostly trash junk.

I may, or may not have notifications/badges enabled for email. I intentionally do NOT send my email to Slack. If you have something IMPORTANT and URGENT, it's best to get hold of me via Slack which stays open during my working hours (even if I'm snoozing pings), or in big emergencies call my phone twice to break through any "Do Not Disturb" functionality. Otherwise, you can expect about a 24hr turn around on email. 

## Slack: The app that carries the most signal

### Direct Message (DM) vs Public Channels

Don't use DM's. When at all possible communicate in public channelswhich ensures highest visibility and the ability for _anyone on the team to search & find later_,  solving [The Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Please only direct message me if we are discussing something that is sensitive or private. (Don't be surprised if I ask you to move the conversation to a public channel.)

### Please Dear God Use Threads

Use public THREADS!!!!! This allows us to have _multiple conversations_ in a single channel without cluttering the channel with interspersed comments. Threads also help people manage their own signal-to-noise ratio. Individuals can mute threads they were mentioned on, or use the "Get Notifified of New Replies" for items they were not mentioned on but want to follow.

### Emoji are Fair Game

To me, Emoji are a perfectly acceptable form of communication. I have few I use commonly: 

- üßµ - This should be threaded on an above conversation, not a new one.
- üëç - I agree, or acknowledge.
- üëé - I disagree, or acknowledge but don't agree.
- ü§î - I'm thinking about this, but I don't have an answer yet or "This is interesting".
- üëÄ - I see this, and I'm actively looking into it.
- ‚úÖ - I've completed this task, or I acknowledge this is done.
- ‚ùå - This is not done, or I disagree with this. (this will often be used in conjunction with a comment explaining why)

### Focus

I mute Slack when I need some "heads down" time, frequently with a headphones emoji as my status. 

If you are worried about pinging me after hours, use the "Send later" feature, but I'll be honest I don't mind getting pings after hours. If I really don't want to see something, I use my device's Focus modes to filter out notifications.

## Meetings: "No agenda? Me no attenda"

A great meeting has 4 things. If you have none of these, I will likely bother you on slack and ask if the meeting is actually necessary. The more you have, the more likely I'll attend.
 
### Members that show up on-time and are engaged

Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable. 

I will often join meeting EARLY to socialize, or re-familiarize myself with supported documents. I also try to end any meetings I'm running early to allow for time to the next meeting. If you are running a meeting, please be respectful of my time and the time of others. If you are late (especially without notice), I will likely start without you.

I'm very expressive so I tend to leave my camera on. I like it when others do too but I understand that not everyone is comfortable with that. Whatever floats your boat dude. üëç

### A clear purpose

When thinking about the "purpose of a meeting" it typically can fit into one of a few categories: 

- Brainstorming (I'm okay if the agenda is a bit sparse here)
- Decision making (It better be clear what decision is to be made. The authority to make the decision BETTER be in that meeting.)
- Status updates (I prefer these to be async when possible, but if you must have a meeting, please have an agenda. Even better if I can help you build a real-time dashboard so there's no need for a meeting.)
- Probably some other modality I'll add here later when someone smarter than me brings it up. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As long as the meeting has a clear purpose, I will likely attend. If it doesn't, I'll probably ask for clarity.

###  Time boxes for each agenda item.

Time boxes help illustrate how long the owner of the meeting intends we discuss a topic, and help us stay on track. If we run out of time, I will likely ask to table the discussion for another meeting, or take it to Slack for asynchronous thoughts. This ensures that the right things get prioritized. 

### Supporting materials that are shared in advance.

Supporting materials like documents, diagrams, or other resources that help us understand the topic at hand are super helpful! If you have these, please share them in advance so I can come prepared to discuss them. If you don't have these, and I know they exist _somewhere_ I may ask you to link to them.

## Project Management: 

I think of my own time management (at work and home) in three phases: `capture`, `refine` and `execute`. I think of project management in the same way. My partner is a Project Manager, and I've learned a lot from her about how to effectively manage projects, and I hope to apply those lessons to my own work. Some of my opinions are HEAVILY influenced by her, and I think that's a good thing. 

### Capture

This is the phase where we gather all the information we need to understand the project. This includes things like requirements, user stories, and other relevant information. Depending on the situation I use [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) Notes to capture information _for myself_ but as soon as it's something that needs to be seen by the team I tend to move it to our Wiki or project management tool where I can get notified of collaborative changes. (See the secton on Tooling Below to see when/why I use each tool.)

### Refine

Taking items from the caputre step, refine is about two things:
1. Make sure relevant information is at hand.
2. Prioritize the work that needs to be done.

I do this for my personal tasks (like household chores, weekend projects etc) in Asana, but I would expect most engineering teams I work on to do this with Jira. These steps often include stakeholders. It's often a practice of moving stuff from various note taking apps (personal & professional plus any Apple Reminders) and ensuring they end up in a project management tool with the information I'll need when I sit down to execute.

### Execute

I like to use the [pEisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) for my personal/household tasks but this mindset can bleed over to my professional life too. 

Do, Schedule (or defer), Delegate, Don't Do. Whenever possible I break a larger task to smaller ones so that it's easy to find 20, 30, 50 minutes to get something rolling. Then I try to do items with the smallest timebox first, and limit the large items to one or two a day. This ensures high velocity of gettin' shit done. üí™

## Working Hours: Shifts like the tides

Both mine and my partner's family aren't local to us so the weekends sometimes require travel. I also like to work hard during the week and allocate some transition time between the work and play. This means that often early Mondays and late Fridays are my availability is decresed. I also try to use those times to schedule my doctor appointsments, trips to the bank, post office etc. That being said if we need to have a meeting in those blocks I'll be there; but I won't schedule those meetings on my own volition.

If you see my green bubble on Slack, it means I'm probably at my desk, or at least monitoring Slack on my phone. Feel free to ping me even if it's outside what a normal human would consider "working hours".

At my best well-rested non-emergency cadence, my schedule tends to look like this:

- Mondays: Start "at desk" around 12pm working later into the evening. 
- Tuesdays, Wednesdays & Thursdays: Start "At desk" between 7 and 930am, take lunch around at 12 (sometimes with a powernap or a walk outside), then back "at desk" until 5, 6 or 7 depending on the tasks at hand and my flow state. Sometimes I pop back on late-night when it's quiet, especially if we need to do an off-hours release and validate that release.
- Friday: Start "at desk" in my robe + coffee between 530 and 8am, trying to wrap up my reflection notes for the day/week around 1pm. If I'm online after 1pm I'd prefer to be doing continual education stuff, reading technical documentation or doing other low-code tasks. Definitely no (planned) releases to production. 
- Saturday & Sunday: Varies, but typically I'm at least watching email and noting anything that needs addressed Monday.
  
If you are worried about pinging me after hours, use the "Send later" feature, but I'll be honest I don't mind getting pings after hours. If I really don't want to see something, I use my device's Focus modes to filter out notifications.

I may send messages late at night, or on weekends. This is because I often work when I feel most productive, and that can be at odd hours. If you see a message from me outside of normal working hours, I DO NOT EXPECT AN ANSWER RIGHT AWAY, I just wanted to get it off my chest so I can focus on other things. I know this can be a problem for some people so I try to be mindful of that follow my own advice from above and use the "Send later" feature whenever I remember.

If you have a high prioirty or urgent message and Slack/Email won't be quick enough, grab my phone number from the company directory and call me. Ring me TWICE to break through Do Not Disturb functionality.

# Tooling

I use a variety of tools in my personal workflow but I often adopt analogous tooling for whatever is going on professionally.

Raycast Notes - Quick floating "sticky notes" that are short lived. They eventually make it into Wiki-Style documentation, are acted on or moved into my personal notebooks. I'm very conscious of what things end up in a personal notebooks or work notebooks. New skills, life hacks or general developer education? Personal Notebooks. Proprietary information, business related operations and continuity of product stuff? You bet that all ends up in a work notebook that lives on the work device/network or a team wiki.

Apple Reminders - I talk to my watch so it puts a reminder in Apple Reminders. These are short lived and when I enter an execution block of time I either execture the task (if it's less than 5 minutes) or move it into some project management software to get refined/scheduled. Typically Jira for work and Asana for personal.

Notion - This functions as my "notebook". If my employer uses this too it often is our Wiki or project documentation.

Asana - Personal project management

Jira - Work management

This list could get much longer if we talk about strictly software tools but for now that's enough.

# Conclusion

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.
