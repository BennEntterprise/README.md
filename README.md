# Kyle's README.md: How to get the most out of your Kyle

This document is a brief description of how to effectively work with me. I've learned a lot of lessons over time and I hope this wil help you get the most out of our interactions.

## TLDR;

- I'm direct, and often sarcastic but I try to be kind and helpful.
- I'm marrying a Project Manager. It's important to me that an engineering team owns and cultivate strong project management practices.
- Ping me whenever, I manage notifications on my devices with Do Not Disturb and Focus modes. If I'm "off clock" you won't be bothering me.
- I prefer one long message, over 20 little ones (Chats, Slack, etc).
- I strive for inbox zero. 
- I have a tendency to skip meetings without a clear agenda in the description, or if I don't see a clear value in attending.
- Sometimes I'll ask _"Do I need to go into (insert topic here)..."_ or _"What do you know about... ?"_ . It's not because I think you're dumb. It's how I stradle not mansplaining, but also ensuring I don't leave you in the dust with SME jargon.

Everything below is a heuristic, and not a hard rule. I try to be flexible and adapt to the needs of the team, but these are some of the things that work well for me.

# Communication

In general I strive to be an _Inbox Zero_ kind of person. I spend a lot of time minimizing superfluous notifications, culitvating a healthy signal-to-noise ratio across my devices and applications. With that in mind, I prefer to keep my communication channels as clear as possible. Here are some guidelines:

## Email: I treat it like snail mail.

As a software developer, I really don't use Email too much. I check it at least once daily (typically in the morning) and will make a note to respond to anything important, however _most_ of my email communication tends to be engineering newsletters I use to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. 

I may, or may not have notifications/badges enabled for email. If you have something IMPORTANT and URGENT, it's best to get hold of me via Slack which stays open during my working hours (even if I'm snoozing pings), or in big emergencies call my phone twice to break through any "Do not disturbe" functionality. Otherwise, you can expect about a 24hr turn around on email. 

## Slack: The app that carries the most signal.

Don't use DM's. Working in public channels is the best way to ensure that everyone can benefit from the discussion. It's also searchable in the future to solve the Lottery/Bus problem. Only DM me if we are discussing something that is sensitive. (Don't be surprized if I ask you to move the convo to a public channel.)

Use public THREADS!!!!! This allows us to have _multiple conversations_ in a single channel without cluttering the channel with a bunch of back and forth. If a thread is getting too long for someone they can chose to mute the thread (unless they are mentioned). If someone wants to _watch_ a thread, they can also opt-in to notifications for that thread. 

To me, Emoji are a perfectly acceptable form of communication. I have few I use commonly: 

- üßµ - This should be threaded on an above conversation, not a new one.
- üëç - I agree, or acknowledge.
- üëé - I disagree, or acknowledge but don't agree.
- ü§î - I'm thinking about this, but I don't have an answer yet.
- üëÄ - I see this, but and I'm activley working on it.
- ‚úÖ - I've completed this task, or I acknowledge this is done.
- ‚ùå - This is not done, or I disagree with this. (this will often be used in conjunction with a comment explaining why)

I mute Slack when I need some "heads down" time, frequently with a headphones emoji as my status. 

If you are worried about pinging me after hours, use the "Send later" feature, but I'll be honest I don't mind getting pings after hours. If I really don't want to see someting, I use my device's Focus modes to filter out notifications.

## Meetings: No agenda, me-no-attenda

A great meeting has 4 things. If you have none of these, I will likely bother you on slack and ask if the meeting is actually necessary. If you have all three you can almost guarentee I will attend and be engaged.
 
0. Members that show up on-time and are engaged.
1. A clear purpose.
2. Timeboxes for each agenda item.
3. Supporting matrerials that are shared in advance.

Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable. I will often join meeting EARLY to socialize, or get started on the agenda. I also try to end any meetings I'm running early to allow for time to the next meeting. If you are running a meeting, please be respectful of my time and the time of others. If you are late (especially without notice), I will likely start without you.

I'm very expressive so I tend to leave my camera on. I like it when others do too but I understand that not everyone is comfortable with that. Whatever floats your boat dude. üëç

When thinking about the "purpose of a meeting" it typically can fit into one of thses categories: 

- Brainstorming (I'm okay if the agenda is a bit sparse here)
- Decision making (It better be clear what decision is to be made. The authority to make the decision BETTER be in that meeting.)
- Status updates (I prefer these to be async when possible, but if you must have a meeting, please have an agenda. Even better if I can help you build a real-time dashboard so there's no need for a meeting.)

As long as the meeting has a clear purpose, I will likely attend. If it doesn't, I'll probably ask for clarity.

Time boxes help illustrate how long we have to discuss a topic, and help us stay on track. If we run out of time, I will likely ask to table the discussion for another meeting, or take it to Slack. This ensures that the right things get prioritized. 

Supporting materials are things like documents, diagrams, or other resources that help us understand the topic at hand. If you have these, please share them in advance so I can come prepared to discuss them. If you don't have these, I may ask you to link to them.

## Project Management: 

I think of my own time management (at work and home) in three phases: `capture`, `refine` and `execute`. I think of project management in the same way. My fiancee is a Project Manager, and I've learned a lot from her about how to effectively manage projects, and I hope to apply those lessons to my own work. Some of my opinions are HEAVILY influenced by her, and I think that's a good thing. 

### Capture

This is the phase where we gather all the information we need to understand the project. This includes things like requirements, user stories, and other relevant information. Personally I use Notion, Asana, and Raycast Notes to capture information _for myself_ but as soon as it's something that needs to be seen by the team I tend to move it to our Wiki or project management tool where I can get notified of collaborative changes.

### Refine

After the first draft of capture, refine is about two things:
1. Make sure relevant informatino is at hand.
2. Prioritize the work that needs to be done.

I do this for my personal tasks (like household chores, weekend projects etc) in Asana, but I would expect most engineering teams I work on to do this with Jira. These steps often include stakeholders.

### Execute

I like to use the Eisenhower Matrix for my personal/household tasks but this mindset can bleed over to my professional life too. 

It boils down to this:
- **Not Important and Not Urgent**: Don't do it. (see if it can be deleted)
- **Not Important but Urgent**: Delegate it to someone else.
- **Important but Not Urgent**: Schedule it for later.
- **Important and Urgent**: Do it now.

## Working Hours: Shifts like the tides

My actual sitting-at-my-desk-hacking hours can fluctuate. I try to do my working day between 7a and 7p Eastern Time, but I often work later in the evening or on weekends. I try to keep my calendar up to date with my working hours, but if you need me outside of those hours, feel free to ping me. I may not respond right away, but I will get back to you as soon as I can.

If you see my green bubble on Slack, it means I'm probably at my desk, or at least monitoring Slack on my phone. Feel free to ping me even if it's outside what a normal human would consider "working hours".

If you are worried about pinging me after hours, use the "Send later" feature, but I'll be honest I don't mind getting pings after hours. If I really don't want to see something, I use my device's Focus modes to filter out notifications.

I may send messages late at night, or on weekends. This is because I often work when I feel most productive, and that can be at odd hours. If you see a message from me outside of normal working hours, I DO NOT EXPECT AN ANSWER RIGHT AWAY, I just wanted to get it off my chest so I can focus on other things. I know this can be a problem for some people so I try to be mindful of that follow my own advice from above and use the "Send later" feature whenever I remember.
